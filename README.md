# My New Angular Portfolio

A personal developer portfolio built with **Angular 20 + SCSS**, adapted from a BootstrapMade template and customized to showcase my skills, projects, and contact details.

- 🌐 **Live demo:** https://my-new-angular-portfolio.netlify.app  
- 💻 **Tech:** Angular 20 · TypeScript · SCSS · (BootstrapMade-based layout) · Netlify

## 🛠 Development Server

This project was generated using **Angular CLI version 20.3.10**.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve

Then open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:4200/

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🧩 Code Scaffolding 

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. For example, to generate a new component:

ng generate component component-name


For a complete list of available schematics (components, directives, pipes, etc.), run:

ng generate --help

## 📦 Building

To build the project for production, run:

ng build


This compiles the project and stores the build artifacts in the dist/ directory.
By default, the production build is optimized for performance and speed.

✅ Running Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with the Karma
 test runner, use:

ng test

## 🔍 Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

ng e2e


Angular CLI does not ship with an e2e framework by default.
You can integrate your preferred solution (e.g. Cypress or Playwright) and wire it up to this command.

## 🙏 Credits

This portfolio started as a BootstrapMade template and was converted into an Angular project during a mentored bootcamp.

Initial Angular setup and project structure were created with guidance from @milazmidza.

I customized the content, sections, styling, and layout to reflect my own profile and projects.

I maintain the code, deploy updates, and use this as my main developer portfolio.

## ℹ️ About This Project

This repository represents my current developer portfolio:
a real-world Angular + SCSS codebase that I use to present myself as a front-end developer, practice modern tooling, and keep improving as I learn.
